##### Usage

Considering the reference table:

|  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |

You can remove multiple columns at once.

e.g: `Columns = { "C", "E", "F" }` or `Columns = { 2, 4, 5 }`

|  A  |  B  |  D  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   | 4   |
